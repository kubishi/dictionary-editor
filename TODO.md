- [x] Set a minimum resolution for the application to work. If the user's screen is too small, show a warning message that the application may not work properly on small screens and suggest using a larger device.
- [x] Allow user to set metadata for PDF (title, author, subtitle, etc.). Put the button to set this info next to the regenerate button in the PDF preview.
- [x] Simplify the export button in the navbar. Make it just a button that automatically downloads the .lift file. PDF export is in the PDF preview, so we don't need a whole page for export options.
- [x] Make dark mode the default.
- [x] For the sake of searching in the browse, can you treat ü and u as the same. Also ŵ as w, ŷ as y?

- [ ] Can we add a tour the first time the user uploads a .lift file? Just a simple one that points out the different sections and especially highlights that they need to export their .lift file. Their changes are saved in the browser, but that shouldn't be relied on (e.g., if they clear their browser history, they will lose their work).

- [x] For the PDF, add the reverse lookup section at the end. ![alt text](image.png)
